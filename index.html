                        This is a complex game.  There are ten columns in the abacus (which uses the Japanese Soroban format).  To recite a digit of π, move that number of columns to the left (when you get to the end, wrap around to the beginning).  Then multiply that digit by the index that you're at, and add it to the number that's already there.  It is rotated 90º to work on mobile devices.
